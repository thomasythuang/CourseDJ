CourseDJ
========

Hello! CourseDJ is an official course scheduling aide for Northwestern that I developed recently. The code was moved to a private repository, which means that the code in this repository is outdated. If you are interested in seeing the up-to-date product, check out http://coursedj.asg.northwestern.edu or email me to ask about the code!
